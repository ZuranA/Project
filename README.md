A simple task tracking application built in Flask. Focusing on the back-end side so the front-end as of now is built with simple HTML templates.

Project Status:

Currently incomplete. 

Currently a user is able to register, login/logout, create a project, invite people to the project, create an issue, edit the issue/resolve the issue and comment on the issue. 

In future I would like to create some sort of user performance model whereby the application would track the number of resolved issues, comments, created issues etc. Furthermore, if I learn some front-end development I may come back to this project and attempt to add a more functional user friendy front end.
